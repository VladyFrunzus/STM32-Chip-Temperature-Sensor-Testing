# STM32-Chip-Temperature-Sensor-Testing
This repository contains all of the files for a project did in STM32 Cube IDE, used for the testing of a TCN75A temperature sensor using an STM32L476RG chip.

The only way to run this project is to have STM32 Cube IDE installed, an STM32L476RG chip, an ST-Link Programmer and a TCN75A temperature sensor. Just upload the downloaded project in the IDE, Build, Run and, using a terminal emulator like PuTTY, see the temperature readings which are updated every second.
